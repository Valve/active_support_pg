active_support_pg
=================

Ever wanted to have your ActiveSupport helpers in your PostgreSQL
database?

Now you can:

```sql
select pluralize('person');
-------------
people

select pluralize('woman');
-------------
women

select pluralize('fox');
-------------
foxes
```

All functions are written in PG/PGSQL language.

To use them in your database, run the contents of `lib/as.sql` inside your
migration:

```ruby
sql = read_sql()
execute sql
```

This is a work in progress, contributions are welcome.

## Running tests (requires ruby)

1. cd into the directory and `bundle install`
1. Copy the `database.yml.example` to `database.yml`
2. Change your connection settings in `database.yml`
3. Run  `rake setup`
4. Run `rake test`
