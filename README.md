active_support_pg
=================

Ever wanted to have your ActiveSupport helpers in your PostgreSQL
database?

Now you can:

### Parameterize

```sql
select parameterize('Ég elska Ísland mjög-mikið');
--------------------------
 eg-elska-sland-mjog-miki

fivesearch=# select parameterize('---**I love iceland**---');
----------------
 i-love-iceland


select parameterize('I love 中國');
--------------
 i-love
```

### Pluralize

```sql
select pluralize('person');
-------------
people

select pluralize('woman');
-------------
women

select pluralize('fox');
-------------
foxes
```

### Humanize

```sql
select humanize('i_love_postgres');
-------------
I love postgres

select humanize('person_id');
-------------
Person

```

### Dasherize

```sql
select humanize('i_love_postgres');
-------------
i-love-postgres

```

All functions are written in PG/PGSQL language.

To use them in your database, run the contents of `src/as.sql` inside your
migration:

```ruby
def up
  sql = File.read(Rails.root.join('db/scripts/as.sql'))
  execute sql
end
```

To drop them, add the contents of `src/as_drop.sql` to the `down`
section of the migration:

```ruby
def down
  sql = File.read(Rails.root.join('db/scripts/as_drop.sql'))
  execute sql
end
```

This is a work in progress, contributions are welcome.

## Running tests (requires ruby)

1. cd into the directory and `bundle install`
1. Copy the `database.yml.example` to `database.yml`
2. Change your connection settings in `database.yml`
3. Run  `rake setup` (only once)
4. Run `rake test`
